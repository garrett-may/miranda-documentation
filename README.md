# Miranda Documentation

The Miranda Programming Language is a functional programming languages
introduced in the mid-80s. Despite its age, it suffers from little documentation,
due in part to the fact that it has not been updated for several years and
projects rarely use Miranda. However, it is a reasonably good language for
teaching the several very basics about employing a functional style when
programming.

This is a set of pages to help provide some more available and easy-to-find
documentation about Miranda. Hopefully this will help teach programmers who want
to understand the concepts of a functional language such as this.
